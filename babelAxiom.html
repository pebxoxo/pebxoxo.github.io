          <p style = "text-align: justify"><strong>B.</strong> There are only a set number of symbols within each book, twenty-two in total. The order and pattern of these symbols are chaotic and, seemingly, random.</p>

           <p style = "text-align: justify"><strong>a)</strong> The library is not infinite, and the books within are all unique and consistent, and perhaps there is a discernable and knowable pattern after all. This is the Pythagorean dream, one of complete and consistent knowability. However this conclusion contradicts axiom <strong>A.</strong></p>
           <p style = "text-align: justify"><strong>b)</strong> The library is infinite, and the books contained within it are repeated over and over again. By this conclusion it is a possibility that we could never get our hands on all the knowledge in the books, despite the fact that we can theorise that the knowledge exists.</p>
           <p style = "text-align: justify"><strong>c)</strong> The final could be that there are in fact axioms and symbols unknown to the mystics, if the library were to be infinite perhaps there are books containing symbols and axioms yet unknown. This conclusion contradicts axiom <strong>B.</strong></p>
