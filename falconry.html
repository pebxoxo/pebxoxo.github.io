          <p>the ancient art of falconry involves mortal pairing with raptor, often a hawk or falcon, and engaging in a mutually understood hunting relationship. this is no domestication, for the raptors relationship to their handler stands precariously on a knife edge. only through consistent repetition of controlled flying, feeding and hunting can the raptor sustain an understanding that their handler is the most convinient source of food possible to them. the world of falconry is wet with its own linguistic world, the jesse and creance being but a small glimmer of this jargon. the falconers relationship to their bird depends on the raptors weight, and indeed the extent of persistent training. raptors less often used include <a href = "index.html">owls</a> due to their nocturnal tendencies and <a href = "vultures.html">vultures</a> due to their predisposition towards already dead foodstuffs, rather than as hunters proper, at least in the traditional sense</p>
