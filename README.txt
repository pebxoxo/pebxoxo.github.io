NOTE ON COMMENTING: I have not done in depth commenting on all the code in this project due to its size and largely modular nature, however every HTML  files contains a brief outline of content, each JS file has some brief description of process and each CSS class has an indication of where it is used.

OUTLINE OF PIECE: This website is meant to be an experience one can come back to, the medium of the website allows your to navigate its 'halls'. There is a puzzle, and many of the pages can be accessed by more than one route to emphasising the inter-connected and across-time nature of the subject matter. It is meant to reflect a certain mystical emphasis on the omnipresent nature of being. The website is a good format for this at it allows you to only be on one page at a time, with multiple possible exit points. You can maneuvre it using either links or the back and forward capabilities on a browser. When you have visited a page it also exists in your history, thus meaning that you will have 'discovered' it and can go visit anytime. Some pages lack the sigil which takes you back to the homepage, this signifying 'points of no return'.

TECHNICAL NOTES: I went into this project with absolutely no background in HTML or CSS, or web design in general and so that was the biggest learning curve to me. I have NOT attempted to make anything technically complex or impressive but instead simply and effectively utilise the medium of the website in an interesting and exciting way. I did challenge my own capabilities however, by learning something completely new for the project.
